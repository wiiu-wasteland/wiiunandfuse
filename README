wiiunandfuse v1.0 by rw-r-r-0644 (based on wiinandfuse v1.1 by yellowstar6)
Mount WiiU SLC/SLCCMPT NAND images with FUSE. wiinandfuse supports raw NAND dumps with ECC.
wiiunandfuse uses the MIT license.
wiiunandfuse output when run without params:

Usage:
wiiunandfuse <nand.bin> <otp.bin> <mount point> <options>
Options:
-p: Use NAND permissions. UID and GUI of objects will be set to the NAND UID/GID, as well as the permissions. This option only enables setting the UID/GID and permissions in stat, the open and readdir functions don't check permissions.
-v: Abort/EIO if HMAC verification of ISFS or file data fails. If ISFS verification fails, wiinandfuse aborts and NAND isn't mounted. If file data verification fails, read will return EIO.
-e: Ignore ECC errors, default is disabled. When disabled, when pages have invalid ECC reads return EIO.

Supported FUSE fs functions:
statfs(statvfs)
getattr(stat)
readdir
open
release
read
rename
chown
chmod
unlink
rmdir
mknod
mkdir
truncate
